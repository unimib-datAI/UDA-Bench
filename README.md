## Repository Quick Start (Updated)

This repository contains:

- `Query/`: SQL workloads and ground-truth tables per dataset
- `systems/`: system-specific runners/adapters (DocETL, Evaporate, Lotus, Quest, DQL, ...)
- `evaluation/`: common evaluation pipeline (`evaluation.run_eval`)
- `orchestrator/`: unified entrypoint to run/evaluate models from one place

### Unified execution (recommended)

Run everything from:

```powershell
python orchestrator/main.py --model <model|all> --dataset <dataset|all> --query-type <select|filter|...|all> --mode <run|eval|run+eval>
```

Examples:

```powershell
# run+eval SELECT for one model
python orchestrator/main.py --model docetl --dataset Finan --query-type select --mode run+eval

# eval-only on existing artifacts
python orchestrator/main.py --model dql --dataset Finan --query-type select --mode eval
```

Main run artifacts are written under:

- `orchestrator/runs/<run_id>/...`

### Final HTML report

Generate:

```powershell
.\.venv-DQL\Scripts\python.exe orchestrator/analysis/select_eval_report.py --dataset Finan --output orchestrator/analysis/select_report.html
```

Open:

```powershell
start .\orchestrator\analysis\select_report.html
```

## 🎯 Project Overview

The explosion of unstructured data has immense analytical value. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to extract table-like attributes from unstructured data, researchers are building LLM-powered systems that analyze documents as if querying a database. These unstructured data analysis (UDA) systems differ widely in query interfaces, optimization, and operators, making it unclear which works best in which scenario. However, no benchmark currently offers high-quality, large-scale, diverse datasets and rich query workloads to rigorously evaluate them. We present UDA-Bench, a comprehensive UDA benchmark that addresses this need. We curate 6 datasets from different domains and manually construct a relational database view for each using 30 graduate students. These relational databases serve as ground truth to evaluate any UDA system, regardless of its interface. We further design diverse queries over the database schema that evaluate various analytical operators with different selectivities and complexities. Using this benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key UDA components—query interface, optimization, operator design, and data processing—and run exhaustive experiments to evaluate systems and techniques along these dimensions. Our main contributions are: (1) a comprehensive benchmark for rigorous UDA evaluation, and (2) a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current systems, paving the way for future work in UDA.

To help users quickly grasp each dataset’s schema, attributes, data distribution, and query workload, we provide an interactive visualization interface. It allows users to browse relational schemas, inspect attribute metadata, view example documents, and explore the query taxonomy, providing a single, easy-to-use interface for exploring and working with UDA-Bench.

  <br>
  <em>Figure 2: Benchmark Construction Process</em>
</div>

### 1. 📥 Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collect data from original sources
- Use MinerU toolkit to parse complex formats (such as PDF)
- Organize datasets into JSON format, where each object corresponds to an unstructured document
- For Healthcare and Player datasets, divide documents into multiple related domains

### 2. 🏷️ Attribute Identification
- Hire 6 Ph.D. students from different majors to carefully read documents
- Identify significant attributes with different extraction difficulties
- Examples: Judge names in legal datasets are easy to identify, while case numbers require full-text search and reasoning

### 3. ✅ Ground Truth Labeling
- Total of 30 graduate students participated in labeling, consuming approximately 4k human hours
- Use multiple LLMs (Deepseek-V3, GPT-4.1, Claude-sonnet-4) for cross-validation
- Adopt semi-automated iterative labeling strategy for large-scale datasets

### System Descriptions:

**Evaporate**: A table extraction system that extracts structured tables from documents, and subsequently executes SQL queries on the resulting tables.

**Palimpzest (PZ)**: Provides Python API-based operators for unstructured data processing. We convert each SQL query into the corresponding PZ code, execute it and obtain the results.

**LOTUS**: Provides an open-source Python library for AI-based data processing with indexing, extraction, filtering, and joining capabilities. We use its interface to execute queries.

**DocETL**: An agentic query rewriting and evaluation system for complex document processing. We directly use the DocETL library to execute queries without any modifications.

**QUEST**: A query engine for unstructured databases that accepts a subset of standard SQL syntax. We directly use their code to execute queries.

**ZenDB**: A system that constructs semantic hierarchical trees to identify relevant document sections. We implement their SHT chunking and filter reordering strategies.

**UQE**: A query engine for unstructured databases that supports SQL-like query syntax with sampling-based aggregation capabilities. We implement its filter and aggregate operators, as well as logical optimizations.

<!-- For a comprehensive evaluation, we adapted and modified these systems to support our evaluation requirements. Detailed adaptation strategies are provided in the appendix. -->
